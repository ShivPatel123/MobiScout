## Project Overview

The MobiScout app is being developed as part of a research initiative at Iowa State University. Its goal is to provide insights into driving behavior by integrating physiological metrics, video monitoring, and vehicle telemetry data. The app includes a watch extension for real-time heart rate monitoring and offers advanced UI designs for improved user experience.

This repository is managed as part of the [Boeing Fellowship Program](https://www.boeing.com), where ongoing development and implementation align with research objectives.
